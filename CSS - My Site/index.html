        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          Hi, my name is Linhaohan Shi, and I come from China.
          I'm currently
          doing my master's program Media Studies in The University of Groningen
          - with the premaster I finished there, I've been in The Netherlands
          for 2 years. 
          Having homesick with the flavors in my memory, I also
          trained myself to become a confident cook - be it Chinese cuisines or
          Japanese cuisines, sometimes even French! I really cherish the
          opportunity of cooking for people I love, and cooking is itself a
          meditation-like experience for me. 
          Besides all above, I'm also
          interested in many other things - films, video games, whisky, gin, and
          craft beers...the list is just getting longer!

          <p>
            I just finished writing my thesis on media distraction for the
            master program Datafication and Digital Literacy at RUG. After
            studying and working in the field of journalism during my earlier
            life, I am now seeking for new knowledge and opportunities in the
            mix of storytelling, research, and data-driven decision making.

          <h3>Data analysis</h3>
          <p>
            Recently, I have been trying to combine my existing expertise in
            media studies with data science skills, in order to enrich my skill
            set and working competence. I obtained several learning certificates
            during studying statistics, programming, and machine learning from
            platforms such as Coursera.
