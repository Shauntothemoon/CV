      I'm currently writing the thesis on media multitasking and memory for my
      master program Datafication and Digital Literacy at RUG. After studying
      and working in the field of journalism during my earlier life, I am now
      seeking for new knowledge and opportunities in the mix of storytelling and
      data science. Considering my previous experiences as a journalist and
      master student, I am a fast learner with strong self-teaching ability,
      motivation, and communication skills. I am willing and confident to learn
      any new skill and knowledge to finish my work. Recently, I have been
      trying to combine my existing expertise in media studies with data science
      skills, in order to enrich my skill set and working competence. I obtained
      several learning certificates during studying statistics, programming, and
      machine learning from platforms such as Coursera.
